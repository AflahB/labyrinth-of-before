labyrinth-of-before
===================

Basic android maze game. Progress through the maze and flip to jump between alternate mazes when you're stuck.

This game is the product of a collaborative effort of second year Software Engineering/Computer Science students as a COMP204/COMP242 group project. Due to the limited timeframe and our inexperience (also partly due to procrastination...ok mainly due to procrastination) the code was written quite haphazardly (SO BE WARNED) and could only play one hardcoded level. The game has since been broken and un-broken. The game is now in alpha stage. It still has a long way to go but it is getting there.

This game can be found on the google play store:
