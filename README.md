labyrinth-of-before
===================

Basic android maze game. Progress through the maze and flip to jump between alternate mazes when you're stuck.

This game is the product of a collaborative effort of second year Software Engineering/ Computer Science students as a COMP204/COMP242 group project. Due to the limited timeframe and our inexperience (also partly due to procrastination...ok mainly due to procrastination) the code was written quite haphazardly (SO BE WARNED) and this game could only play one hardcoded level. I've since then broken it and I'm now in the process of rebuilding it and curating it. Hopefully I will be able to bring this to its former glory and beyond (...maybe also get the attention of my team mates in the process). If this game can be restored to a decent working order then I will be releasing this on Google Play (free of charge, of course...perhaps).

As of now I don't think I will be accepting any contributions (other than, from my team mates), thank you. This is a public repo so as I understand it, you can fork it. I cannot stop you from doing so (I think), however I will be making this repo private soon...when I get my student pack.
